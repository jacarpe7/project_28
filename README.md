## The Idea
<p align="center"><img src="media/ASU-Logo.gif" width="200"><img src="media/Microchip-Logo.png" width="200"></p>
  2020 was a huge year for humanity. Overnight there were unlimited problems being faced on a day to day basis. Whether it be social distancing, mask wearing, or quarentine. Our project had the goal to help solve one of these problems with a focus on software being developed by students at ASU, and the hardware being built and provided by Microchip.


  With this goal in mind, we knew a large problem people faced in a time where it wasn't known how long COVID survived on physical surfaces was to help avoid touching surfaces while operating through a daily routine. The goal was to develop a sensor, and using machine learning process data from the sensor to eliminate the need for a user to physically touch surfaces that other people would also be touching.


  The team bounced around with several ideas. But one that really stuck out to us was the need for people to touch an ATM. The ATM, originally designed in 1967 hasn't seen any updates in years. Still requiring a user to use a pin pad, touching a surface that many other people could have touched. We decided that this was going to be the focus of our project.
