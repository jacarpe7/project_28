## The Idea
<p align="center"><img src="media/ASU-Logo.gif" width="200"><img src="media/Microchip-Logo.png" width="200"></p>
  2020 was a huge year for humanity. Overnight there were unlimited problems being faced on a day to day basis. Whether it be social distancing, mask wearing, or quarentine. Our project had the goal to help solve one of these problems with a focus on software being developed by students at ASU, and the hardware being built and provided by Microchip.


  With this goal in mind, we knew a large problem people faced in a time where it wasn't known how long COVID survived on physical surfaces was to help avoid touching surfaces while operating through a daily routine. The goal was to develop a sensor, and using machine learning process data from the sensor to eliminate the need for a user to physically touch surfaces that other people would also be touching.


  The team bounced around with several ideas. But one that really stuck out to us was the need for people to touch an ATM. The ATM, originally designed in 1967 hasn't seen any updates in years. Still requiring a user to use a pin pad, touching a surface that many other people could have touched. We decided that this was going to be the focus of our project.

## What Didn't Work
  The first step of our design process involved using the QT-7 sensor pictured below. We used this to get an idea of what the data looked like coming off of the sensor. We originally though the QT-7 had the chance of being a proximity sensor for a real world application. Through thurough testing we quickly disocvered that we were unable to get accurate and consistent results. This took us back to the drawing board.

  After the QT-7, Bob tipped us off to a friend's company of his that designs paint that is electronically conductive and could potentially detect proximity of a user's hand. Once we realized this; the next iteration of design is the proximity sensor pictured below.

  When we started testing and applying Machine Learning to the data being produced from the sensor above. We quickly once again realized that the data was not accurately able to detect what direction a users hand was coming from. As the paint sensors were too close to eachother. We reached out to Bob and collectively put up a series of designs for potential sensors. Below are the results of those design mockups.

  After talking through several of these designs and their upsides we landed on the one below. After testing we were quickly able to apply our machine learning algorithm to the resulting sensor and able to detect hand motions at a very high accuracy. We will discuss this further later on.
