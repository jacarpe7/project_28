# Python ATM Interface
### Revision 3/15/2021

**General Usage**</br>
- As of this revision the ATM interface no longer contains buttons, except for 'Cancel' and 'Clear'.  The numpad, side buttons, and 'Enter' have been removed.
- The gesture listener is currently mocked with a keyboard listener; enter key represents a hover gesture, and left/right arrows represent corresponding swipes.
- When executing the program on launch you will see the main welcome screen.  To advance to the main menu simply hover (press enter).
