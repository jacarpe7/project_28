### Quality Policy


**GitHub Workflow** 
  > Branches will be named US# (where # is the user story number)  
  > Branch from Development (Dev) into your US# branch.  
  > Work on your new US branch.  
  > Each commit message needs to state the US and task number and describe what you did. 
  > When User Story is done, merge current Dev into your US branch.  
  > Test if everything works after Dev was merged into your US branch.  
  > If everything worked well, create a Pull Request to Dev and request a review from someone to double check.  
  > If you feel you are falling behind in your section, please communicate with the team.  
  > Keep your work within your own branch.  
  > Don't write bad, unorganized code. Instead follow the coding practices we have all had classes in.  
  > Keep repo names short and understandable.  
  > Comment on what your code does. 
  > Only push to GitHub when your code is operational.
  > If code is not operational continue to commit to your local repo.  
  > Do not create branches for each individual task.  
  > Check Taiga with vigilance. 
  > Verify correct branches are being merged (Dev <- New Code).  
  > Update Deliverable when necessary  


**Code Review** 
The following are our review policies for both developer and reviewer:  
  > The developer will answer the following questions in their pull request:  
    > Why was this code needed?  
    > Was the most recent version of dev pulled before this request?  
    > Does this code follow standard conventions?  
  > The reviewer will answer the following questions while reviewing:  
    > What does this code do and how?  
    > Does this code meet the functional requirements it's trying to fulfill?  
    > Is this code understandable?  
    > Does it have proper comments?
