# Quality Policy

## GitHub Workflow

- Branches will be named US# (where # is the user story number)
- Branch from Development (Dev) into your US# branch.  
- Work on your new US branch.
- Each commit message needs to state the US and task number and describe what you did.
- When User Story is done, merge current Dev into your US branch.
- Test if everything works after Dev was merged into your US branch.
- If everything worked well, create a Pull Request to Dev and request a review from someone to double check.
- If you feel you are falling behind in your section, please communicate with the team.
- Keep your work within your own branch.
- Don't write bad, unorganized code. Instead follow the coding practices we have all had classes in.
- Keep repo names short and understandable.
- Comment on what your code does.
- Only push to GitHub when your code is operational.
- If code is not operational continue to commit to your local repo.
- Do not create branches for each individual task.
- Check Taiga with vigilance.
- Verify correct branches are being merged (Dev <- New Code).
- Update Deliverable when necessary
