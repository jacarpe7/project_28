3. Decide on which category of sensor you would like to add and click the down arrow by it. (for gestures, you probably want to choose the 2D Surface.)

4. Select the number of channels (not sure on this one), technology (I think we’d choose Mutualcap because it allows x and y sensing), and the gesture type (one or two finger).

5. Click Add in the same drop down menu.

6. Click to move the sensor where you’d like it.

7. You can combine sensors to create a lump sensor (click and drag selection to combine), however, this does not appear to be necessary for the 2D Surface, where the channels take care of that.

8. Need to check with Bob to determine how the size of this thing works and if it can be configured or if it just takes up the whole thing.
