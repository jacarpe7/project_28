As of right now, there are several options, but more information is needed from our sponsor.  I believe after a brief email, that our best option is to use the libraries available in C through Atmel to transmit the data with "high level packet information" to Python.  That data will then be put into data structures, where we will then use it in ML.  The issue right now is figuring out how to extract that data differently than it is done in the datastream file, and then using something like a ctypes wrapper to get that data into Python.  Further investigation will be done into the datastreamer and how it works.  

Right now I've had a hard time figuring out exactly how the data is deserialized as the actual functions that do it are in NDA protected libraries.  My hunch is that writing a similar file to the datastreamer file and having the data transmit into a data structure in C (that can then be serialized and transmitted to Python) is going to be the best way to do it.
