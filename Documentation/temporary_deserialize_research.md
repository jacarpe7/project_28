As of right now, there are several options, but more information is needed from our sponsor.  I believe after a brief email, that our best option is to use the libraries available in C through Atmel to transmit the data with "high level packet information" to Python.  That data will then be put into data structures, where we will then use it in ML.  

In order to get that data into a place that is easily transferrable to Python, I believe that we need to figure out how to place the data coming from the bytestream that we want, into a data structure (probably just an array), which I have figured out the basics of in Task 46.  Bob is going to have more information for us Monday, because I believe, since the bytestream is continuous, that we will have to substitute some pseudo-bytestream for the real one while we are using our custom datastream.  Extending this custom datastream file to Python should be a relatively easy thing to do.
