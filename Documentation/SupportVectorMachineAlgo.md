# Support Vector Machine

### Overview

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) goal is to find hyperplanes that separate the data points into categories in N-dimensional space, corresponding to the number of features [1].  The larger the margin (distance between points from different classes) the better.  We are more confident of our results the higher this margin is.  

### Real World Examples 
Some real world applications of this algorithm include facial expression categorization, which is very similar to our project's goal I think.  Using SVM, this allows a system to categorize your happy/sad/mad/surprised face correctly and act based on that.  I think that is basically a gesture of the face, so it seems to be that this could also be a viable option for our project.  Other uses include texture classification, which is the ability to classify surfaces as smooth or rough.  Also this is used for text classification, for example differentiating between different peoples' handwriting styles and being able to identify.
