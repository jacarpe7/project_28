# Getting From Atmel to TensorFlow

## First Getting the data into Python

### Python Development</br>

Anaconda looks to be a very viable option for our Python development purposes, as it is a toolkit specifically used for data science and machine learning.  It utilizes the Spyder IDE and contains other useful tools.  It can be downloaded [here]("https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual").

### Python Data Structures

After research, a very good option appears to be the Pandas framework.  It can be used to directly import the CSV files generated by Atmel Studio directly into a data structure called a DataFrame.  A sample project including a small data file exported from Atmel using the QT7 is in the folder titled "python_qt7".  After installing the Anaconda toolkit and ensuring you have the latest repo files, just open the project folder.  We'll also likely need to use the NumPy Python library, which includes high-level mathematical functions that can operate on large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices of data.

### Installing TensorFlow in Anaconda

1. After installing Anaconda, open an Anaconda Command Prompt as an Administrator (as opposed to the regular command prompt, this can be found in the Start menu by searching "Anaconda")
2. Run the below commands to install the latest release of CPU-only TensorFlow.  You will need to type "y" to some prompts at times.
	
```
conda create -n tf tensorFlow       # This creates the TensorFlow environment in Anaconda and calls it 'tf'.
conda activate tf           		# This will activate the environment you just created
conda install pandas                # This will install the Pandas toolkit into the environment
```

I found a cheatsheet for various Anaconda Prompt commands [here]("https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.0/_downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/conda-cheatsheet.pdf").

3. Now launch Anaconda and on the Home tab select the tensorFlow environment in the dropdown and install Spyder:

![anaconda-home](https://i.ibb.co/ftfRB3H/anaconda-home.jpg)</br></br>

4. Once Spyder has installed, launch it and open the project folder ***python_qt7*** and confirm you can compile and run the file ***tensorflow_demo.py***.  If you do not get any errors then your environment is setup to code in Python with Pandas and TensorFlow.
