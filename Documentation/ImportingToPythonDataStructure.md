# Getting From Atmel to TensorFlow

## First Getting the data into Python

### Python Development</br>

Anaconda looks to be a very viable option for our Python development purposes, as it is a toolkit specifically used for data science and machine learning.  It utilizes the Spyder IDE and contains other useful tools.  It can be downloaded [here]("https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual").

### Python Data Structures

After research, a very good option appears to be the Pandas framework.  It can be used to directly import the CSV files generated by Atmel Studio directly into a data structure called a DataFrame.  A sample project including a small data file exported from Atmel using the QT7 is in the folder titled "python_qt7".  After installing the Anaconda toolkit and ensuring you have the latest repo files, just open the project folder.
