### Quality Policy

**GitHub Workflow** 
  > We will maintain a develop branch. The develop branch will be the branch where we merge all completed UserStories by a pull request. This will be enforced by github settings. Each user story will have its own branch, each task  will be created on its associated story branch. When a task is complete, it is then PR'd on github (with no review required). This is to ensure that github will mark the branch as 'merged', and better facilitate organization.

>The name of the branch will follow 'US#', where the # will be the one assigned on the taiga board. When a developer assigns themselves a task, they then branch from the UserStory branch, and follows the convention of 'US#-Task#', where the numbers also correspond with the taiga board. 

>We will try to ensure develop doesn't break, but when it does, a seperate branch in the form of Fix-#, where # is the current bug fix.

>Each commit message needs to describe what you are working on with US# and Task # (also include things like "Unit Test", be descriptive). Read the following for more information on commit messages: https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/

>At least one team member should approve a PullRequest, review it, and the reviewer should not be the member who started
>the pull request.

>Only one team member (Git master) is allowed to do the merge into Master (different person for each Sprint)! In case that person is not available for some reason, someone else is allowed to do it, but please provide a comment in the pull request for it. The Git master is the one who should make sure that all Pull Requests are fast forwards and that all pull requests are approved by someone. Thus, talking to the team and making sure Pull Requests are done correctly. Then the Git master should only push the "merge" button on GitHub.

>Branches will not be deleted after they are completed.


**Unit Tests Blackbox** 
  > Unit Tests will be conducted on a task while the task is in the "ready for test" phase on Taiga (Waiting to be merged into develop)
  
  > All unit tests will be placed in the src.test.java folder.
  
  > Each member will conduct at least 4 unit tests per sprint. (on your code or other people's code)
  
  > Whe committing a Unit Test to a task, you will commit it via 'US# Task# Unit Test: ...'
  
  > Unit tests will be setup to produce jacoco reports
  
  > Unit tests will be focused on areas that are no related to UI elements.


 **Unit Tests Whitebox**

- [ ] All public methods have a method banner comment and/or javadoc comment present and filled in
- [ ] My code is stylistically consistent
     - [ ] Indentations are consistent

     - [ ] There are no spelling mistakes
- [ ] I use proper naming conventions

	  OR
     - [ ] Variable, Parameter, and Method names are lowercase with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability (Python)

- [ ] All literal values, except loop indices, are declared as constants (no hard coding)

  > Include a checklist/question list which every reviewer will need to fill out/anser when conducting a review, this checklist (and the answers of course) need to be put into the Pull Request review.

**Static Analysis**  
  > Team members will contribute to the massive backlog of StaticAnaylsis bugs by submitting at least 20 SA fixes caught by checkstyle and 20 SA fixes to spotbugs. If there aren't any bugs, then team members will obviously not need to contribute to fixing any more. The dedicated SA fixes will be created on a seperate branch with SA-Task#, where the task number is created with a storyless task on the taiga board. This will be done so that we can accruately show off our progression as we tackle these bugs.
  
**Continuous Integration**  
  > For continuous integration, we will make sure that the Travis CI develop build passes with each pull into the develop branch. At the end of the sprint, we will also make sure that the build passes for the pull into the master branch.
